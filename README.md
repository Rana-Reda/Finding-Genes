# Finding-Genes
This project solves an important scientific problem which is finding genes within a long dna.
A gene within a dna should start with a start codon(ATG) and end with one of the three stop codons(TAA,TAG,TGA).
It is so hard to extract a gene from a long dna by hand and isn't accurate at all even it's a short dna.
So in this project we will go step by step in working with dna starting with extracing simple dna in #part1 using the known start codon and only one of the three stop codon:TAA.
Then in #part2 we will modify to get the gene with the right length as not every gene that starts with start codon and end with stop codon is a real gene.
In #find all stop codons we will work on three of the stop codons instead of just one.
And then we will work on all the information on genes from dna as the real problem we want to solve.
