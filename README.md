# Finding-Genes
This project solves an important scientific problem which is finding genes within a long dna.
A gene within a dna should start with a start codon(ATG) and end with one of the three stop codons(TAA,TAG,TGA).
It is so hard to extract a gene from a long dna by hand and isn't accurate at all even it's a short dna.
So in this project will go step by step in working with dna starting with extracing simple dna in #part1 using the known start codon and only one of the three stop codon:TAA, and then makes sure that the length of this gene is correct for a valid gene.
Then in #part2 will modify to get the gene with unknown start and stop codon and to work with dna that is either uppercase letters or lowercase.
In #find all stop codons I worked on three of the stop codons instead of just one.
And then worked on all the information on genes from dna as the real problem i want to solve.
I also worked with the storageresources and how to use them to ease and make code more acuurate with large data.
