# Finding-Genes
This project solves an important scientific problem which is finding genes within a long DNA. 
A gene within a DNA should start with a start codon(ATG) and end with one of the three stop codons(TAA,TAG,TGA). 
It is so hard to extract a gene from a long DNA by hand and isn't accurate at all even it's a short DNA. 
So in this project will go step by step in working with DNA starting with extracting simple DNA in #part1 using the known start codon and only one of the three stop codon: TAA, and then makes sure that the length of this gene is correct for a valid gene. 
Then in #part2 will modify to get the gene with unknown start and stop codon and to work with DNA that is either uppercase letters or lowercase. 
In #find all stop codons I worked on three of the stop codons instead of just one. 
And then worked on all the information on genes from DNA as the real problem I want to solve. 
I also worked with the storage resources and how to use them to ease and make code more accurate with large data.
