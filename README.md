# Finding-Genes
This project solves an important scientific problem which is finding genes within a long dna.
A gene within a dna should start with a start codon(ATG) and end with one of the three stop codons(TAA,TAG,TGA).
It is so hard to extract a gene from a long dna by hand and isn't accurate at all even it's a short dna.
So in this project we will go step by step in working with dna starting with extracing simple dna in #part1 using the known start codon and only one of the three stop codon:TAA, and then maks sure that the length of this gene is correct for a valid gene.
Then in #part2 we will modify to get the gene with unknown start and stop codon and to work with dna that is either uppercase letters or lowercase.
In #find all stop codons we will work on three of the stop codons instead of just one.
And then we will work on all the information on genes from dna as the real problem we want to solve.
We will also work with the storageresources and how to use them to ease and make our code more acuurate with large data.
